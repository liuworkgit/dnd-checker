# dnd-checker
A simple webapp made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It features a simple guide to creating a level one DnD character as well as a checklist on the side telling the user what they've done so far.

This project was made for the purpose of learning the basics of front-end, and as such does not reflect my current skill level.
