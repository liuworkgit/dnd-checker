        <h1>DnD Character Creation Checklist</h1>
        <h2>Step One - Class, Race and Name</h2>

        <h3>Choose Your Character's Name</h3>
        <p>Skip this step if desired, since it’s simple.</p>

        <h3>Pick a Class</h3>
        <p>In the story, your character’s class is their profession. Game mechanic wise, it determines how
            your character can be played, granting you access to specific skills, proficiencies and talents.</p>

        <!--needs alt text-->
        <p>There are many classes to choose from, with <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes">this list of
                classes</a> by DnD Beyond a good place to start.</p>

        <h3>Pick a Race</h3>
        <p>In the story, your character’s race is what species they are. Similar to class, this determines traits and
            skills your character naturally has.</p>

        <p>Just like classes, there are many races to pick; DnD Beyond has <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races">a
                list of races</a> you can pick from.</p>

        <h3>Pick a Background</h3>
        <p>In the story, the background gives a general picture of your character’s origin story. As a mechanic, it
            gives your character access to additional skills and proficiencies. A character doesn’t get more traits from
            their background, while they would from their class.</p>

        <p>Again, DnD Beyond provides <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds">a list of backgrounds</a> to
            choose from.</p>

        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <p> In DnD, alignments are moral guidelines for your character’s actions. They tell you how your character
            behaves.</p>
        <p>There are nine total alignments in DnD:</p>
        <!--add padding and borders-->
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Lawful Good</td>
                <td>Neutral Good</td>
                <td>Chaotic Good</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lawful Neutral</td>
                <td>Neutral Neutral (True Neutral)</td>
                <td>Chaotic Neutral</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lawful Evil</td>
                <td>Neutral Evil</td>
                <td>Chaotic Evil</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>These are guidelines and not hard rules to obey. If they feel too restrictive, feel free to not use them.</p>

        <h3>Experience Points</h3>
        <p>Some DnD campaigns are played with experience points, earned through various feats in the game. Here is where
            you’d record them. If you’re starting out with a level one character, write zero.</p>

        <h2>Ability Scores, Skills, and Usable Stats</h2>
        <h3>Ability Scores</h3>
        <p>These determine a character’s aptitude for certain physical and mental tasks. There are six in total:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strength</li>
            <li>Dexterity</li>
            <li>Constitution</li>
            <li>Intelligence</li>
            <li>Wisdom</li>
            <li>Charisma</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To calculate an ability score, take four d6 dice, roll them, and add together the three highest numbers.
            There is also a predetermined set of ability scores provided by WoTC that you can distribute among the
            scores, if you’d like.</p>
        <p>Then, look at your race: this will increase some of your ability scores. For example, a Dragonborn race
            increases both a character’s charisma and strength by 1.</p>
        <p>The little circle below is where you put the ability score’s modifier. This is a number you either add or
            subtract from dice rolls depending on what task you’re trying to accomplish. Depending on what your ability
            score is, your modifier will vary accordingly:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>2, 3</td>
                <td>4, 5</td>
                <td>6, 7</td>
                <td>8, 9</td>
                <td>10, 11</td>
                <td>12, 13</td>
                <td>14, 15</td>
                <td>16, 17</td>
                <td>18, 19</td>
                <td>20</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-5</td>
                <td>-4</td>
                <td>-3</td>
                <td>-2</td>
                <td>-1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>+1</td>
                <td>+2</td>
                <td>+3</td>
                <td>+4</td>
                <td>+5</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Inspiration points are rewarded to the player by the game master for playing one’s character true to their
            personality. Characters start out with no inspiration points, so leave this blank.</p>
        <h3>Proficiency Bonus</h3>
        <p>This is a number that is added to dice rolls for tasks that a character is proficient in, or good at.
            Proficiencies will be covered later.</p>
        <p>This number is determined by the level of your character, and increases as you level up. At level 1, your
            proficiency bonus is +2.</p>
        <h3>Saving Throws</h3>
        <p>These are rolls made when your character needs to resist something, such as an attack or a spell. When the
            situation arises, you roll your dice and add your saving throw modifier to it.</p>
        <p>The modifier is determined by your ability score’s modifier. Each class has proficiency in at least two
            ability scores, meaning you can add your proficiency bonus to the ones you’re proficient in. Find the
            related modifier – calculate if you’re proficient – and write it in the boxes.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>These are the specific areas your character is good at. Each skill is tied to an ability score. Your
            character’s background and class tell you which skills you’re proficient in, meaning you can add your
            proficiency bonus to the modifier.</p>
        <p>Find the related modifier – calculate if you’re proficient – and write it in the blank spaces.</p>
        <h3>Passive Perception</h3>
        <p>unlike the perception skill, passive perception relates to whether your character can notice things without
            deliberately paying attention.</p>
        <p>It is calculated by adding your wisdom modifier to 10. If your character is proficient in the perception
            skill, add the proficiency bonus too.</p>
        <h2>Section 3</h2>
        <p>The middlemost box at the top contains your character’s armour class, initiative, speed, hit points, hit
            dice, and death saves.</p>
        <h3>Armour Class</h3>
        <p>the armour class is the score enemies must beat in order to deal damage to your character. For example, if
            your character’s armour class is 17, then an enemy attacking you must make an attack roll that’s 17 or
            higher. (?)</p>
        <p>Specific classes will offer different armour class upgrades at certain levels. For example, a barbarian gets
            Unarmoured Defense at level 3, to which their AC can be calculated by 10 + their dexterity modifier + their
            constitution modifier.</p>
        <p>If your characer is unarmoured, your armour class – AC – is 10 plus your dexterity modifier.</p>
        <p>If your character is armoured, depending on what armour they’re wearing, you will use that armour’s AC plus
            your dexterity modifier. If your character is proficient in the armour they wear, they get to add their
            proficiency bonus to their AC. If your character isn’t, however, you will have disadvantage on ability
            checks, attack rolls involving dexterity or strength, saving throws, and will be unable to cast spells.</p>
        <h3>Initiative</h3>
        <p>This is a modifier you add to the dice roll that determines when you go in battle. It is equal to your
            dexterity modifier.</p>
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <p>this determines how much your character can move in a round of combat. This is race-specific, but can be
            improved by other factors such as class. Check your race to see your character’s speed.</p>
        <h3>Hit Points</h3>
        <p>these determine your character’s health. At level 1, it can be calculated by adding your constitution
            modifier to a certain number. The dice you use to calculate how much HP you get in later levels are
            determined by your class.</p>
        <p>Temporary hit points are hit points that don’t last forever, and can be conferred for a time by certain
            effects.</p>
        <h3>Hit Dice</h3>
        <p>the dice you use to calculate how much health is regained from healing. It increases with level. At level
            one, you get 1 hit dice, at level two, you get two, so on and so forth.</p>
        <h3>Death Saves</h3>
        <p>when your character has been knocked unconscious at 0 HP, each time your turn comes around you need to roll a
            d20 and add any modifiers or bonuses to it. You must beat a 10 for a success, or you get a fail. Three fails
            results in permanent death, while three successes means your character becomes stable at 0 HP again. This is
            only really relevant in battle or dangerous situations, so leave this blank.</p>
        <h2>Section 4</h2>
        <p>The last boxes contain information on attacks and spellcasting, other proficiencies and languages, equipment,
            and features and traits.</p>
        <h3>Attacks and Spellcasting</h3>
        <p>here is where you’d list the attacks you could make, which is reliant on what weapons your character has.</p>
        <h3>Other Proficiencies and Languages</h3>
        <p>This is where other proficiencies listed by your class can go. As well, each race and some classes allow your
            character rto speak certain languages.</p>
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>all characters start out with default equipment as dependent on their class. This can also be used to list
            certain items you pick up along your character’s journey.</p>
        <h3>Features and Traits</h3>
        <p>any abilities granted by your race and class go here.</p>
